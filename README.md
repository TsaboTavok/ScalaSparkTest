# Simple Scala/Spark demo project.


Goal of this task was to setup local Scala/Spark environment, create a stuctured project with tests and implement a Spark algorythim.
The implemnted Spark algorythms should be infinitely horisontally scalable with a calulation complexity no worse then logarithmic.
